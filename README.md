# Camdar does dotfiles and other things

by Cameron Wong (cjwong@andrew.cmu.edu)

Inspired heavily by [Jake Zimmerman](https://github.com/jez/dotfiles).

Once upon a time, a young CS student realized that he was Very Annoyed at the
random minor differences between his rc files on different systems. And also
it was getting annoying copying vimrc changes between various remote hosts.

In the process of making his vim Git Gud (tm), he stumbled upon a mysterious
blog post about [rcm](https://blog.jez.io/2015/03/09/getting-started-with-rcm/)
and got to thinking. Of course, the *sane* thing to do would be to whip up an
rcm configuration for himself, but no... this student had to be *unique*. And
by *unique*, we really mean "overly complicated".

## Installation

One way or another, get scripts/init onto the host system. Running that script
should clone this repo onto the system and make all the necessary symlinks.

Note that this isn't exactly designed for use by people that aren't me, so just
cloning the repo and running with it is probably not going to work particularly
well.

## Things of Note

I'll be blogging about it here (TODO: actually make this blog post).

## Credits

I've gone through at least two revisions of this repo. In particular, I'd like
to give a shoutout to jez (mentioned at least twice above), who inspired me to
go through with this in the first place.
